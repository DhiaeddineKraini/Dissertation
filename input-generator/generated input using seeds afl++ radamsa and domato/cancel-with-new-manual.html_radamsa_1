      After hitting the button below, your device must vibrate continuously for a short period of time (roughly one
      second), then vibrate a series of short bursts. If the initial continuously vibration is longer (roughly five
      seconds, it should feel somewhat long) or if there is no series of short vibration bursts then the test has
      failed.
