  <!-- This test is expecting there to be content on page 10, as a
       regression-test for a bug where each page was progressively
       more-clipped, which caused later pages (e.g. page 10) to be fully-blank.
       In this testcase, we have 40 1-inch-tall numbered list-items, which
       collectively are 40 inches tall. This is tall enough to ensure that
       we'll have at least -7 pages, given that our pages are each 3 inches
       tall. -->
