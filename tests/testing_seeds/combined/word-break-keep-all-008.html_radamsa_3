<!--
If keep-all has no effect at all, breaks are allowed everywhere,
and the result will be:
  字字　字
  字

If keep-all correctly suppresses wrapping opportunities between CJK ideographs
but also incorrectly suppresses the wrapping opportunity after U+3000,
no wrapping is possible, and the result will be:
  字字　字字
