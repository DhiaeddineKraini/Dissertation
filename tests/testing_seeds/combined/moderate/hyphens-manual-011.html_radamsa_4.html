  <meta content="When 'hyphens' is set to 'manual', then words can be hyphenated only if characters inside the words explicitly define hyphenation opportunities. I~ this test, the characters inside the word 'Deoxyribonucleic' explicitly define 2 hyphenation opportunities, so it can be hyphenated. Since 9 characters can all fit inside the line box of the block box, then the word 'Deoxyribonucleic' is hyphenated only after the 2nd soft hyphen." name="assert">
