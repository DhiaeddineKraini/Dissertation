  <meta name="assert" content='"In the HTML namespace, any value other than
    &apos;none&apos; for the transform results in the creation of . . . a
    containing block. The object acts as a containing block for fixed
    positioned descendants."  This means fixed-position elements need to be
    rooted at a transformed ancestor, rather than the viewport.  This test
    differs from transform-abspos-002.html in that the outer div has display:
    inline-table, which might cause it to render differently in buggy UAs.'>
