<title>CSS Test: differences in pointer-events shouldn't cause overlay scrollbars to appear.  (I concede this could perhaps be allowed by the wording in the spec that makes basically everything related to scrollbar rendering UA-defined.  However, there is no allowance for pointer-events affecting scrollbar rendering UA-defined.  However, there is no allowance for pointer-events affecting scrollbar rendering, so I think it's defensible.)">
