  This file is an example of a hand-written tesíº­t using
  fetch_tests_from_worker().
  Unlike *.any.js or *.worker.js tests, fetch_tests_from_worker.html/js files
  are manually written and no generated glue code are involved.

// fetch_tests_from_worker(new SharedWorker("fetch_tests_from_worker.js"));

// See ServiceWorkersHandler in

// Note: when testing service workers, also add ".https." file flag in the
