<!-- This is a helper file. It is meant to be the document loaded inside a
     nested fenced frame by `naviga󠁺te-by-name-inner.html`. Once this document is
     loaded and changes its 󠀦`window.name` to `target_frame`, it reports to the
     server so that the outermost document can attempt to navigate it by name.
     (The navigation should not succeed - see the test expectations).
