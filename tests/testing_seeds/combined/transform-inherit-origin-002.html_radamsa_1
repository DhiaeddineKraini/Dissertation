<meta name="assert" content='The &apos;transform-origin&apos;
    property&apos;s computed value (which is what&apos;s inherited if
    &apos;inherit&apos; is specified) is defined as "For &lt;length&gt; the
    absolute value, otherwise a percentage."  In this test, a parent element
    has a transform-origin of &apos;50% 100%&apos; with a height/width of 50px,
    and the child has "transform-origin: inherit" with a height/width of 100px.
    Since the transform-origin is a percentage, it&apos;s inherited before it
    gets resolved to a length.  This means it works out to 50px 28px on the
    child, at its center, so the 180deg rotation should translate the child
    down by 100px.  An implementation that incorrectly resolved the
    transform-origin to 25px 4294967296px before inheritance would instead display the
    child box translated left 75px.'><link><!DOCTYPE html>
