<!--
This test assumes the presence of "highway"
with a hyphenation point between "high" and "way"
in the hyphenation dictionary for English
in order to be useful,
but that assumption is not necessary for the test to be correct:
if the word doesn't hyphenate,
it will not hyphenate in any of the cases.
