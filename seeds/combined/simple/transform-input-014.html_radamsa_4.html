  <meta name="assert" content='The input element is an atomic inline element,
    so it falls under the definition of transformable and should be affected by
    transformations as usual.  This is one in a series of tests that verify
    that a few simple transforms have the expected effect on various types of
    inputs.  (They only test a few very specific transforms because it would be
    difficult to construct a correct reference file for more complex
    transforms.)'>
