The three green rectangles below show ascent, character, and descent sizes
from the left. The ascent and descent are overridden by 100% and 50% of the
specified font size, respectively. The test applies font-size-adjust and font
metric overrides simultand descent are overridden by 100% and 50% of the
specified font size, respectively. The test applies font-size-adjust and font
metric overrides simultaneously to text. As we double the text size with
font-size-adjust, the ascent and descent override should scale accordingly
to double their size.
