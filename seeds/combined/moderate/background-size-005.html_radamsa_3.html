<!DOCTYPE h value is the width of the correspoding image and the second value (corresponding to the height of the background image) is assumed to be 'auto'. An 'auto' value for one dimension is resolved by using the image's intrinsic ratio (in this test, the image's intrinsic ratio is 1:1) and (multiplied by) the size of the other dimension. Therefore the used width and height of the background-size in this test should be 60px and 60px.">
