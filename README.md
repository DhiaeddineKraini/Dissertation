# FuzzBrowse: An Advanced Framework for Automated Browser Security Auditing

This repository contains the dissertation project for my BSc (Hons) in Computer Science for CyberSecurity. **FuzzBrowse is not just a script; it is a complete, end-to-end framework for discovering complex security vulnerabilities in modern web browsers.**

The goal was to move beyond basic fuzzing and engineer a sophisticated, feedback-driven system that mimics the rigorous testing processes used by elite security teams. The project culminated in the discovery of a **verifiable memory leak in Google Chrome**.

### High-Level Architecture
The system was designed with a modular, pipeline-based architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and a clear separation of concerns, reflecting professional software engineering standards.

## üèÜ Key Achievements & Impact

This project successfully demonstrates the ability to take a complex security concept from research to a functional, effective prototype.

*   **Discovered a Verifiable Memory Leak in Google Chrome:** Using an ASan-instrumented build, the fuzzer identified a reproducible memory leak (8-byte direct, 344-byte indirect) in Chrome's core content module, proving the framework's effectiveness in finding real-world bugs.

*   **Engineered a Novel Mutation Strategy:** I designed and implemented a "Fractal Crossover" mutation algorithm. This advanced technique intelligently combines complex HTML documents to create unique, high-entropy test cases that are more likely to uncover deep, structural bugs than random fuzzing.

*   **Built a Resilient, End-to-End Automation Framework:** The system automates every step of the process: generating test cases, running them in a headless browser, detecting a wide range of anomalies (not just crashes), and collecting detailed forensic data for analysis. It was designed for stability, running for **144 continuous hours** without failure during the final evaluation.

*   **Quantified a 14.8% Efficiency Gain via Coverage-Guided Fuzzing:** By integrating feedback from the Chrome DevTools Protocol, I proved that the fuzzer could intelligently direct its efforts to under-tested code paths, resulting in a **14.8% higher** weighted JavaScript coverage score and a more efficient bug-hunting process.
